# must never leave root_path (see compare_controller.js#_navigate).

  # desktop default so every row clears both bars without scroll gymnastics.
  # The hero's mini-timeline (EventsHelper#hero_events) grew the homepage's
  # above-the-fold height by ~170px, so this needs a bit more headroom on
  # top of that to keep clicks on the fixed compare tray unambiguous.
